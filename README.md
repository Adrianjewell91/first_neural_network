### A simple neural network, based on a tutorial

A neural network learns to predict outcomes given a set of data. The set of data includes the inputs and their expected outputs. The neural network then decides the importance of each input such that given a new set of data, the outputs will match the expected outputs.  In this way, the neural network has 'learned' to answer questions.

This is the result of my following of a tutorial (https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/), and also after being motivated to build a network.
