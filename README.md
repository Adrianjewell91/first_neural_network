### A simple neural network, based on a tutorial

A neural network learns to predict outcomes given a set of data. The set of data includes the inputs and their expected outputs. This is the result of my following of a tutorial (https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/), and also after being motivated to build a network. 

1. Step one, install environment according to this tutorial:
