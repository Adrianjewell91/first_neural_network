### A simple neural network, based on a tutorial

A neural network learns to predict outcomes given a set of data, in which the set of data includes the inputs and their expected outputs. The neural network then decides the importance of each input such that, given a new set of data, the outputs will match the expected outputs. In this way, the neural network has 'learned' to answer questions.


The math behind how a neural network does this is rather complicated and not in scope of their brief demonstration. Basically, a neural network is the  transformation of a vector of inputs into a single output by transforming the input vector into the output value, where the number of layers in the neural network corespond with the number of intermediate vectors between the  input and the output. eg. A three-layer NN starts with the input vector, which is transformed into a hidden vector, which is transformed into the final vector (single value, but could be multiple value, depending on the desired output.). 

This is the result of my following of a tutorial (https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/), and also after being motivated to build a network.
